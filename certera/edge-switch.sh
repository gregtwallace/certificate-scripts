# INSECURE! - This script should be considered for lab/testing only as tftp is inherently insecure.
# Additionally, there is no user authentication for tftp so anyone could download the key/cert while
# it is being served.
# TL;DR - Transmitting keys through this script risks them being compromised. Use at your own risk!!!

# Script for updating key/cert on edge switches

# Required: expect, python3, and tftpd-hpa must be installed to run this script.

# To get the edge switch to properly send the full cert chain, the files uploaded should be (in order of appearance in concatenated file)
##	SSL Trusted Root Certificate PEM File = Intermediate CA Cert, CA Root Cert
##	SSL Server Certificate PEM File = Server Key, Server Cert

# Due to limits of the console on edge switch, a server is needed to run the script (i.e. this script doesn't run on the switch)

## Recommended cron -- run at boot (in case system was powered off
# during a renewal, and run weekly)
# Pick any time you like. This time was arbitrarily selected.

# sudo crontab -e
# @reboot sleep 15 && /script/path/here
# 5 4 * * 2 /script/path/here

# NOTE: IMPORTANT!!  curl commands below use -k flag (don't check ssl cert) because I run this script on localhost
# (the cert server itself). Remove -k flag if you are NOT using localhost.

## Set VARs in accord with environment
# server with the key/cert api running
certserver=localhost

tftp_server=certdp.local
# local path for the tftp server's root
