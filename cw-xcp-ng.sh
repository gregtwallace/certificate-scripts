# compromising the API Keys

# I placed the script in /root/certwarden and it seems fine.

# Recommended cron -- run at boot (in case system was powered off
# during a renewal, and run weekly)
# Pick any time you like. This time was arbitrarily selected.

# sudo crontab -e
# @reboot sleep 15 && /script/path/here
# 5 4 * * 2 /script/path/here

# NOTE: If Cert Warden server is running on a VM, add sleep 300-600 to wait 5-10 minutes for
# the VM to come up
